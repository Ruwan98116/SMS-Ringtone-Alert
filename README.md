# SMS-Ringtone-Alert

A mobile Android application that listens for incoming SMS messages and triggers a ringtone alert when a predefined keyword is detected. This app is useful for scenarios where you need immediate attention from specific SMS messages, such as for emergency alerts, important reminders, or notifications.

## Features
- **SMS Keyword Detection**: The app listens for incoming SMS messages and compares the content with a saved keyword.
- **Ringtone Alerts**: When the keyword is matched, the app plays a loud ringtone, ensuring you don't miss important messages.
- **Foreground Service**: Runs as a foreground service to ensure continuous operation, even when the app is in the background.
- **Notification Management**: Displays persistent notifications to indicate the status of the service (e.g., "Listening for SMS...").
- **Volume Control**: Automatically adjusts ringtone and media volumes to maximum to ensure the alert is heard.

## Permissions Required
- **SMS Permission**: To read incoming SMS messages.
- **Modify System Settings**: To adjust the phoneâ€™s ringer mode and volume.
- **DND Permission**: To manage the Do Not Disturb settings to ensure alerts are audible.
