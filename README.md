Notification Management: Displays persistent notifications to indicate the status of the service (e.g., "Listening for SMS...").
Volume Control: Automatically adjusts ringtone and media volumes to maximum to ensure the alert is heard.
Permissions: Requests necessary permissions for reading SMS, modifying system settings, and managing Do Not Disturb (DND) mode.
